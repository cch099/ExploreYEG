### Park and stroll - nature right there! 
Sorry for the long break, but bike crash and burn took a toll and awhile to heal.  But, I'm back.

Off to the point of this post:

Can you believe this, just a short walk off the main street.

This little gem of a hike is hidden but accessible if you dare to explore.

This little hike is surrounded by beauty and very easy from a hike level.    No bikes, just hikes.   Take that for what it's worth.

Once again, from here, the trail network is extensive.  You can go all the way to snow valley.
