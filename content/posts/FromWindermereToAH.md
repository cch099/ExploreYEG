### How to get from Windermere to Anthony Henday Bridge by hike or bike 

With Edmonton's wonderful network of bike trails, wouldn't it be great to reach them from the Windermere area?

Unfortunately for Edmonton Southwest/Windermere residents, there's no easy, direct connection to a paved or gravel pathway. Instead it involves jumping off from the end of 16 Ave and hopping on a grassy trail. 

For us less adventurous types that don't want to waste time following dead ends or getting lost.  I thought this post would help those that are curious but wasn't sure what's really there.  There's not a lot of images about getting to that starting point, or what the path is like. So, here you go.

This grassy trail isn't too bad to traverse.  It can get a little muddy and slippery after a rainy day, but nothing too dangerous other than mosquitoes!

Follow the trail until it starts to descend into the riverbank.

That trail hugs the trees line along the Anthony Henday Drive will take you most of the way there except ...

**BEWARE!**  If you follow the trail to the end down the hill, be prepared to get muddy.  The end of the trail is lower  than the Henday paved pathway. The paved path starts further up the hill.  If it rained recently, you'll end up hiking up with your bike and muddy shoes.  Not fun!

The paved bike paths end right at the Anthony Henday Bridge.

Once you reach the AH pathway, away you go!   The world's your oyster ... happy exploring.
