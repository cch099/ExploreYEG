### Love this park

Can't get enough of the river valley.   Let's take Terwillegar Park for example.

The park is located in the southwest of the city, situated by a bend in the North Sasketchewan River.   It's multi-use:  lots of trails, off-leash, tons of space, and the main entry way to the Terwillegar Footbridge.

What's great is that the park is easy to get to via bike or car.   I can see why the parking lot is always packed.

From here, Fort Edmonton is a short walk/bike trip away.  It's a gateway for visitors to Edmonton's trail network.

For those who haven't visited the footbridge, it's nice:
