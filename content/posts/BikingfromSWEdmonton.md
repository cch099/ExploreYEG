### Where do you want to go?

I've been biking quite a lot with COVID forcing all of us to adapt.  It's my way of exercising and getting outdoors.   To give some context, I haven't ridden a bike for over 10 years.   Biking outdoors and exploring, what could be better?

I'm always amazed where I can go in the city using the bike trails.   The network of trails and pathways are incredible!
Other than limitations on time and weather, I can reach most places in the city.

Take today's ride for example:  

From
Windermere &#8594; Terwillegar Park &#8594; Fort Edmonton &#8594; Hawerlak Park 

Sprinked in the trails are little architectural gems and tranquil spots (as transquil as you can get while moving).

Every trip has the potential for detours.  This one is no different.  Had to check out [Keillor Point](https://www.edmonton.ca/projects_plans/parks_recreation/keillor-point-viewing-area.aspx)

For those who don't know how to get to the stairs located on the right side of the whitemud drive (heading westbound) towards the 149 street turnoff.  It's in __Sir Wilfred Laurier Park__.

It's was supposed to be Heritage Days this weekend, but nonetheless, a nice day at Hawerlak.

Who would have guessed it was ~33 km, while 28&deg;.  Sure didn't seem like a 2 hour ride.

What a wonderful ride. Scenic.  Convenient.  Challenging.

You really get the best of all worlds.   For those that want the connected pathways, and the elevation for cardio workout, and the scenery.  Check, check and check.

I'm biased when it comes to preferring paved/gravel pathways.   Road tires and mud does NOT mix!

But I digress.   For those that want a little or a lot, it's all there.  

If you want it: 
-   lots of off the beaten paths right off the main pathway.
-   flat to hilly paths.  The route is up to you.
-   not into scenery?   Want shortest path from point A to B.  Mix it up with main roads and paved trails.

Again, a smorgasboard of options.   

Thanks for the trails YEG.
